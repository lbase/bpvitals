bpvitals blood pressure database using sqlite

These forms now use both databases:

[postgresql](http://flatboy/adminer/adminerstart.php?pgsql=flatboy&username=rfile&db=rfile&ns=public&select=vsigns_bp)

and sqlite:

[sqlite file](file:///data/sqlite/vitals.db)

Stashing forms and execution code in ~/python3/bpvitals/forms

For use in desktop shortcuts. Will try and keep up to date but unbroken.

Script in bpvitals called rsync_forms
